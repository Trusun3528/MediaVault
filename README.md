# MediaVault

MediaVault is a simple self-hosted web app for storing and organizing your personal photos and videos. It's a project I built to have more control over my media without relying on third-party services.

## What is MediaVault?

It's a web application where you can upload, view, and organize your photos and videos. The idea is to have a private and secure place to store your media, especially if you don't feel comfortable using cloud-based solutions. 

The app is designed to be straightforward and easy to use, with a clean interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a way to:
- Keep my personal media secure and private.
- Avoid subscription fees for cloud storage.
- Have a bit of fun learning and building something useful.
